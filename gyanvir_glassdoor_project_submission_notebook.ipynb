    "This project focuses on understanding and predicting salaries based on job listings and company-related information. The primary aim was to analyze patterns in salary distribution and build a model capable of predicting average salaries using features like job type, company size, location, industry, and rating. The dataset included job postings from various companies, with details such as estimated salary ranges, employer-provided salary flags, and categorical information like sector, ownership type, and state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step involved cleaning the dataset by removing or transforming unclear values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. We also explored the skewness of data and handled it selectively, only where it improved the model's effectiveness. Feature selection was guided by correlation and tree-based importance scores. Initial visual analysis revealed that average salaries varied significantly with company size, job type, and location. For example, both very large and very small companies offered relatively higher salaries compared to mid-sized firms, and California-based jobs had generally higher salary averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "We trained two models—Linear Regression and Random Forest—to predict salaries. While Linear Regression gave us a baseline with low predictive power (R² ≈ 0.15), Random Forest significantly outperformed it with an R² of around 0.67. Feature importance scores from Random Forest indicated that hourly jobs, job state, company rating, and industry were among the most influential variables. Hyperparameter tuning was also performed, although the tuned model slightly underperformed compared to the default in terms of R², indicating that the original settings may have generalized better for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We addressed the core objectives of the project by successfully building a salary prediction model, visualizing how average salary varies by company size, identifying the top predictive features, and evaluating different models to recommend the best-performing one. This approach not only enables accurate salary prediction but also helps in understanding what truly drives compensation differences in job markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future improvements could involve incorporating textual data from job descriptions, using deep learning or NLP-based models, and deploying the solution as an interactive web application. This would make it easier for job seekers or HR departments to use the model for salary benchmarking and decision-making.\n"

    "1. Accurate Salary Prediction Model:\n",
    "    - With Random Forest achieving a strong R² score, the model provides a reliable way to estimate salaries for new job listings, helping employers set competitive offers and job seekers evaluate offers realistically.\n",
    "1. Feature Transparency for HR Teams:\n",
    "    - The model highlights key drivers of salary (e.g., job type, state, and company rating), giving HR and compensation teams clear direction on what influences pay the most across different job roles."

    "While Linear Regression is easy to understand and implement, its poor performance indicates that the salary structure is not linearly related to the features. Hence, relying on this model for salary prediction in a real-world business scenario could lead to inaccurate estimates and misinformed decisions.\n"
